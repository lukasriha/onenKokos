# Hi,

my name is Lukas. This is my private repo and I use it mostly for completing frontend challenges or other small personal projects.
Technologies I use include (but are not limited to): 

- ✨ React
- ✨ Next.js
- ✨ TypeScript
- ✨ Node.js / Express

<!---
onenKokos/onenKokos is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
